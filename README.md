# Customer Segmentation and Analysis

This repository contains files for a customer segmentation and analysis project aimed at grouping customers based on their transaction behaviors using unsupervised learning techniques. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), K-Means clustering, and detailed insights into customer segments, transaction patterns, and preferred product categories.

## Project Files

1. **Divya_Aggarwal_EDA.pdf**  
   - The final report for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer and transaction data, detailing initial data exploration, cleaning, and key insights.

2. **Divya_Aggarwal_EDA.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook with the step-by-step analysis, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization processes to understand the dataset.

3. **Divya_Aggarwal_Lookalike.csv**  
   - A dataset containing customer profiles and transaction details used for segmentation analysis.

4. **Divya_Aggarwal_Lookalike.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook with analysis and feature engineering, including aggregating transaction data for each customer to aid in segmentation.

5. **Divya_Aggarwal_Clustering.pdf**  
   - A comprehensive report on the clustering analysis, covering the number of clusters formed, business insights from the segments, and performance evaluation metrics.

6. **Divya_Aggarwal_Clustering.ipynb**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook detailing the clustering process, including the application of K-Means, the Elbow Method to determine optimal clusters, and the evaluation of results using metrics such as the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index
